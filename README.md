- 👋 Hi, I’m @OneTradeAway
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things, most specifically anything that I can learn and master and also teach. If it's a skill that I can make money with, even better!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python and React are next. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything cool that helps me build a solid knowledge base, helps the community at large and is worth the experience. 
- 📫 How to reach me Twitter @UnaTradeAway, Discord @OneTradeAway#6550
